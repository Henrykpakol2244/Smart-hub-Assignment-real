Comments in Python are identified with a hash symbol, #, and extend to the end of the line. Hash characters in a string are not considered comments, however. There are three ways to write a comment - as a separate line, beside the corresponding statement of code, or as a multi-line comment block.

There are multiple uses of writing comments in Python. Some significant uses include:

Increasing readability
Explaining the code to others
Understanding the code easily after a long-term
Including resources
Re-using the existing code
